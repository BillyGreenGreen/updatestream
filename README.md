# Twitch Stream Updater

This application was developed to help myself manage switching game on the streaming platform Twitch.tv with the use of their API that allows for the changing of the particular catergory your stream is under, paired with checking what game is currently open from a set list of games allows for the catergory to be updated automatically.

The project is quite old and the API keys have been taken out.
